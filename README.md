Forecasting Case Study

**Background**

You are provided with a time series dataset containing ACV distribution data across:

• 15 different products

• 57 distinct markets

• Historical weekly data

**Task**

• Develop a single forecasting model to predict weekly ACV for the next 18 months.

    o Forecasts should be made for 3-5 product-market combinations only.

    o Focus on either a global model (aggregated) or local models (individual product-markets).


• Choose one of the following forecasting approaches:

    o Statistical methods (e.g., ARIMA, ETS).

    o Machine Learning Models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest).
    
    o Deep learning techniques (e.g., LSTM, Prophet).

    
• Provide a brief justification for your model selection:

    o Explain why the selected model is appropriate based on performance, interpretability, and time constraints.

    
• Make a simple recommendation:

    o Provide insights based on the forecasts for the chosen product-market combinations.


**Evaluation Criteria**

• Technical Implementation in Python:

    o Code should be modular and clear.
    
    o Include basic steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. 
    
• Quality of Final Recommendation and Justification:

    o Provide concise, actionable insights supported by basic visualizations.

**Deliverables**

1. Python Code
   
   o Implement the model, preprocessing steps, and evaluation pipeline.

   o Provide a well-commented script or notebook.

   
2. Model Performance Analysis:
   
    o Evaluate performance using basic metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
   
    o Include one or two visualizations (e.g., actual vs. forecast plots).
   
4. Final Recommendation:
   
    o Summarize the model performance and practical application.
   
    o Provide one actionable insight (e.g., a trend or critical observation).



Focus on delivering concise, clear results with minimal complexity.
